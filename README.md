# Foundations Deep Reinforcement Learning

Implementing the base algorithms of Deep Reinforcement Learning in Python. The goal of this repository is not to create a package whose algorithms
can be used as efficiently as possible. Instead, the goal is to create a package with most core Reinforcement Learning algorithms implemented
separately, solely for study purposes. Therefore, there are almost no modular components, such that the code for all algorithms can be studied
independent of each other.

Based on the book: `Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning, Theory and Practice in Python`
